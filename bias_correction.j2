To address media bias when evaluating sources it is necessary to dig into incentives. Not just political alignment.

If one were to rank the following in terms of their ability to drive attention, and thereby fund ad-supported media, and then rank them again in terms of their benefit to humanity:

1. Truth
2. Beauty
3. Love
4. Sex
5. Violence
6. Fear
7. Anger


For driving attention in ad-supported legacy media:  
1. Violence - Grabs attention with drama.  
2. Sex - Draws curiosity, effective in ads.  
3. Fear - Creates urgency, focuses viewers.  
4. Anger - Engages via emotional controversy.  
5. Truth - Credible but less sensational.  
6. Love - Appeals in human interest stories.  
7. Beauty - Visual draw, less emotional.  

For utility for good:  
1. Truth - Builds trust, informs decisions.  
2. Love - Fosters empathy, social bonds.  
3. Beauty - Inspires, uplifts well-being.  
4. Fear - Raises awareness, risks panic.  
5. Anger - Motivates change, can divide.  
6. Sex - Useful for education, often sensationalized.  
7. Violence - Mostly negative, may highlight justice.

This inversion suggests ad-supported media or engagement driven social media can often prioritize elements harmful to humanity for profit, making critical evaluation essential.

# Advice
- When evaluating information from a media source, especially if it's ad- or engagement-focused, realize that you need to re-evaluate sources by prioritizing human-benefit elements over attention-grabbers.
- Beyond 'both sides,' logically assess facts, incentives, and primary sources from a distribution of viewpoints.
- Though alignments with good are possible, some sources have built a reputation on Truth rather than simple engagement, but that's not generally where the money is, given human engagement patterns.
- Additionally, while mathematics itself is generally neutral, be skeptical of presented numbers and statistics, as they can be manipulatedâ€”consider the book 'How to Lie with Statistics' for insights.
- In controversies, steelman each side (i.e., strengthening an argument to its most defensible form) by constructing the strongest plausible version of their argument, especially as media often weakens arguments for sensationalism; then rigorously check it against verified facts, basic mathematical plausibility, primary sources, and a distribution of viewpoints.
- On claims involving numbers/stats in controversies, independently verify via tools (e.g., search/browse for primary data like maps/measurements), steelman sides, compute plausibility math, and highlight incentive-driven distortions.
